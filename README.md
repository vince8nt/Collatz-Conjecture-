# Collatz-Conjecture-
Computes and analyses the patterns of the Collatz Conjecture.

The Collatz Conjecture is based around the group of sequences:
Given an arbitrary integer as the first term,
for all following terms:
if the previous term n is even  it = n/2
if the previous term n is odd   it = 3n+1

The conjecture states that all sequences starting with positive integers
eventually reach 1. (the infinate loop ... , 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, ...)

The Collatz Conjecture is unproven although highly tested.
